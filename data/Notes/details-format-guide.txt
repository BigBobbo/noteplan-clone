# Task Details Format Guide

This file demonstrates the correct indentation format for task details with bullet points.

## Basic Details (Simple Text)

* Task with simple details
    This is a detail line
    This is another detail line
    Details continue until we reach a less-indented line

## Details with Bullet Points

**IMPORTANT**: Bullet points within details must be indented one MORE level than the detail text.

* Task with formatted details
    This is the description of the task.
    It can span multiple lines.

        * Bullet point 1 (indented 8 spaces total)
        * Bullet point 2
        * Bullet point 3

    Back to regular detail text (4 spaces).

## Details with Nested Bullets

* Complex task
    Description of the complex task:

        * Main bullet point
            * Nested bullet (12 spaces total)
            * Another nested bullet
        * Another main bullet

    **Bold text** and *italic* work too!
    Code: `npm install`

## Multiple Tasks

* First task
    Details for first task
        * Bullet in first task

* Second task
    Details for second task
        * Bullet in second task
        * Another bullet

## Tasks with Both Details AND Subtasks

* Parent task
    This is a detail of the parent task
        * Bullet within parent's details
    * Child task 1
    * Child task 2
        Child task 2 has its own details
            * Bullet in child task 2's details

## Why This Indentation?

The system uses 4-space indentation per depth level:
- Task at depth 0: 0 spaces
- Details at depth 1: 4 spaces
- Bullets within details at depth 2: 8 spaces
- Child tasks at depth 1: 4 spaces (but marked with `*`)

This way, the parser can distinguish:
- Child tasks: Start with `*` at depth 1 (4 spaces)
- Detail text: Plain text at depth 1 (4 spaces)
- Bullets in details: Start with `*` at depth 2+ (8+ spaces)
