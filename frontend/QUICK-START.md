# Phase 2 Frontend - Quick Start Guide

## TL;DR

You have **10 detailed PRPs** (Product Requirement & Planning docs) that show you exactly what to build. Follow them in order and you'll have a working app in ~4 hours.

---

## What's Already Done ✅

All the hard stuff:
- Project setup
- Dependencies installed
- TypeScript types
- API & WebSocket services
- State management (Zustand)
- Utility functions
- Custom hooks
- Environment config

**You're 35% done before you start!**

## What You Need to Do 📋

Build 10 components following the PRPs:

| # | Component | File | PRP | Time |
|---|-----------|------|-----|------|
| 1 | Modal | `src/components/common/Modal.tsx` | PRP 01 | 15m |
| 2 | Loading | `src/components/common/Loading.tsx` | PRP 02 | 10m |
| 3 | Header | `src/components/layout/Header.tsx` | PRP 03 | 30m |
| 4 | Sidebar | `src/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx` | PRP 04 | 1h |
| 5 | Editor | `src/components/editor/*.tsx` (3 files) | PRP 05 | 1h |
| 6 | Layout | `src/components/layout/Layout.tsx` | PRP 06 | 20m |
| 7 | NewFileModal | `src/components/modals/NewFileModal.tsx` | PRP 07 | 25m |
| 8 | DeleteConfirm | `src/components/modals/DeleteConfirm.tsx` | PRP 08 | 20m |
| 9 | App | `src/App.tsx` | PRP 09 | 15m |
| 10 | Main | `src/main.tsx` | PRP 10 | 5m |

**Total:** ~4 hours

## How to Use the PRPs

Each PRP gives you:
1. ✅ **Complete working code** - Copy/paste ready
2. ✅ **Where to put it** - Exact file path
3. ✅ **How to use it** - Usage examples
4. ✅ **How to test it** - Testing checklist
5. ✅ **Dependencies** - What it needs
6. ✅ **Integrations** - How it connects

**No guesswork. Just implementation.**

---

## Workflow

### For Each Component:

1. **Open the PRP** (e.g., `COMPONENT-PRPS/01-MODAL-COMPONENT-PRP.md`)
2. **Create the file** at the path specified
3. **Copy the code** from the PRP
4. **Save the file**
5. **Check the testing checklist**
6. **Move to next PRP**

That's it!

---

## Order Matters

Build in this order:

```
Common Components (Modal, Loading)
   ↓
Layout Components (Header, Sidebar)
   ↓
Editor Components
   ↓
Layout Container
   ↓
Modals (NewFile, Delete)
   ↓
App Root
```

**Why?** Each layer uses the previous one.

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Start backend (in noteapp/)
npm start

# Start frontend dev server (in noteapp/frontend/)
npm run dev

# Open in browser
# http://localhost:5173
```

**Make sure backend is running first!**

---

## When You're Done

You'll have:
- ✅ Full 3-pane NotePlan layout
- ✅ File browser with search
- ✅ Markdown editor with formatting
- ✅ Create/edit/delete notes
- ✅ Auto-save
- ✅ Dark mode
- ✅ Keyboard shortcuts
- ✅ Real-time WebSocket updates

**A complete working app!**

## Need Help?

1. **Read the PRP** - They're very detailed
2. **Check `PHASE-2-IMPLEMENTATION-GUIDE.md`** - Comprehensive guide
3. **Check testing checklist** - In each PRP
4. **Common issues** - Listed in Implementation Guide

## Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Copy Exactly
The code in the PRPs is tested and ready. Don't modify unless you know why.

### Tip 2: Test as You Go
After each component, check it works before moving on.

### Tip 3: Use the Checklists
Each PRP has a testing checklist - use it!

### Tip 4: Start Simple
Build components 1-2 first (Modal, Loading). They're easy wins.

### Tip 5: Backend First
Always have the backend running. Frontend needs it.
