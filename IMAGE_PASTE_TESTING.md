# Image Paste Feature - Testing Guide

## Overview
This document provides comprehensive manual testing instructions for the image paste feature, since automated Playwright tests require browser downloads that may be restricted.

## ‚úÖ Automated Tests Completed

### Backend API Tests (Verified with curl)
All backend endpoints have been tested and work correctly:

1. **‚úÖ Upload Endpoint** - `POST /api/upload`
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/upload -F "image=@test.png"
   # Returns: { success: true, filename, relativePath, size, warning }
   ```

2. **‚úÖ Stats Endpoint** - `GET /api/upload/stats`
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:3001/api/upload/stats
   # Returns: { count, totalSize, totalSizeMB, assetsDir }
   ```

3. **‚úÖ Cleanup Endpoint** - `POST /api/upload/cleanup`
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/upload/cleanup \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"notes": []}'
   # Returns: { success, count, filenames }
   ```

### File System Tests (Verified)
- ‚úÖ Assets directory created: `/root/Documents/notes/Notes/assets/`
- ‚úÖ Images uploaded with timestamp naming: `image-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS.ext`
- ‚úÖ Orphaned images detected and deleted correctly

## üìã Manual Testing Checklist

### Setup
1. Start backend server: `node src/server.js`
2. Start frontend dev server: `cd frontend && npm run dev`
3. Open browser: http://localhost:5173

### Test 1: Paste Image from Clipboard
1. Open or create a note in the editor
2. Copy an image to clipboard (screenshot, image file, etc.)
3. Click in the editor and press `Cmd+V` (Mac) or `Ctrl+V` (Windows/Linux)
4. **Expected:**
   - Console shows: `[Editor] handlePaste called`
   - Console shows: `[Editor] Image found in clipboard, uploading...`
   - Console shows: `[Editor] Image uploaded successfully: assets/image-...png`
   - Image appears in the editor
   - File saved to `~/Documents/notes/Notes/assets/image-TIMESTAMP.png`

### Test 2: Drag and Drop Image
1. Open or create a note in the editor
2. Drag an image file from your file manager
3. Drop it into the editor
4. **Expected:**
   - Console shows: `[Editor] handleDrop called`
   - Console shows: `[Editor] Image found in drop, uploading...`
   - Console shows: `[Editor] Image uploaded successfully: assets/image-...png`
   - Image appears in the editor at drop position
   - File saved to `~/Documents/notes/Notes/assets/`

### Test 3: Large Image Warning
1. Copy a large image (>5MB) to clipboard
2. Paste into editor
3. **Expected:**
   - Image uploads successfully
   - Alert/warning shown: "Image is large (X.XX MB). Consider resizing."
   - Console shows warning message

### Test 4: Image Persistence
1. Paste an image into a note
2. Wait for auto-save (1 second)
3. Reload the page
4. Open the same note
5. **Expected:**
   - Image still appears in the editor
   - Note file contains: `![filename](assets/image-TIMESTAMP.png)`

### Test 5: Image Markdown Format
1. Paste an image into a note
2. Save and close the note
3. Open the note file in a text editor
4. **Expected:**
   - File contains: `![filename](assets/image-TIMESTAMP.png)`
   - Relative path format (not absolute)

### Test 6: Image Selection and Styling
1. Paste an image into the editor
2. Click on the image
3. **Expected:**
   - Image shows blue outline when selected
   - Image has rounded corners
   - Image hover effect (slight opacity change)

### Test 7: Multiple Images
1. Paste multiple images into a note
2. Save and reload
3. **Expected:**
   - All images appear correctly
   - All images saved to assets folder
   - All images referenced in markdown

### Test 8: Different Image Formats
Test with various image formats:
- PNG (most common)
- JPG/JPEG
- GIF
- WebP
- SVG (if supported)

**Expected:** All formats upload and display correctly

### Test 9: Image Deletion from Note
1. Paste an image
2. Delete it from the editor (select and press Delete/Backspace)
3. Save the note
4. **Expected:**
   - Image removed from editor
   - Image NOT removed from assets folder (orphan cleanup handles this)

### Test 10: Orphaned Image Cleanup
1. Create a note with an image: `![Test](assets/test-image.png)`
2. Remove the image reference from the note
3. Run cleanup via API:
   ```bash
   # Get all notes content first
   curl http://localhost:3001/api/files
   # Then run cleanup
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/upload/cleanup \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"notes": [...]}'
   ```
4. **Expected:**
   - Orphaned images identified and deleted
   - Response shows count and filenames

## üêõ Known Limitations

1. **Browser Download Required for Automated Tests**
   - Playwright tests exist in `test-image-paste.spec.js`
   - Cannot run without browser binaries (blocked by network)
   - All backend functionality verified with curl

2. **Image Resizing**
   - CSS styling for resize handles is implemented
   - Manual drag-to-resize may require additional Tiptap extension
   - Images can be resized by clicking and dragging (if browser supports)

3. **Image Compression**
   - Compression function exists in `imageUtils.ts`
   - Not automatically applied (user must confirm)
   - Can be integrated with size warning dialog

| Cleanup endpoint | ‚úÖ PASS | Correctly identifies and deletes orphans |
| File creation | ‚úÖ PASS | Images saved with timestamp naming |

## üöÄ Performance Considerations

1. **File Size Limits**
   - Frontend warns at 5MB
   - Backend hard limit at 10MB (multer config)
   - Adjust in `/src/routes/uploadRoutes.js` if needed

2. **Network Upload**
   - Uses multipart/form-data
   - No chunking (suitable for images up to 10MB)
   - Consider chunking for video support in future

3. **Storage Cleanup**
   - Manual cleanup via API endpoint
   - Could be automated with cron job
   - Could run on app startup

## üìù Files Involved

### Backend
- `/src/services/imageService.js` - Image handling logic
- `/src/routes/uploadRoutes.js` - Upload API endpoints
- `/src/server.js` - Route registration

### Frontend
- `/frontend/src/components/editor/Editor.tsx` - Main editor with paste/drop handlers
- `/frontend/src/utils/imageUtils.ts` - Upload and validation utilities
- `/frontend/src/index.css` - Image styling

### Tests
- `/test-image-paste.spec.js` - Playwright tests (requires browser)
- This file - Manual testing guide

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Images not uploading
1. Check backend is running: `curl http://localhost:3001/health`
2. Check console for errors
3. Verify network tab in browser DevTools
4. Check backend logs for multer errors

### Images not appearing after reload
1. Verify file was saved: `ls ~/Documents/notes/Notes/assets/`
2. Check markdown syntax in note file: `![alt](assets/filename.png)`
3. Verify relative path is correct
4. Check browser console for parsing errors

### Large file warnings not showing
1. Check file size: `ls -lh image.png`
2. Verify alert() function is called in `imageUtils.ts`
3. Consider replacing alert() with proper notification system
